# Strength-Of-Schedule-Lua

This app is used to assess and compare the strength of schedules for all robots competing in an FRC robotics competion.  It uses the-blue-alliance API.  It is written in lua.  You can run it by launching it like this:

lua sos.lua orore2016

This will output the strength of the schedules of the qualification matches at the Oregon City District event of 2016.  You can determine the event id for an event by going to that event on the blue alliance and observing it in the web link in the address bar.
